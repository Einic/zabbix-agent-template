### Installation

##### Notice

Before manual installation you should check `Include` option in your `zabbix-agent` configuration, it should be uncomment and check that include path are the same with this installation rule - https://github.com/Einic/zabbix-agent-template/blob/main/zabbix-template-elasticsearch/src/Makefile#L54 otherwise you should change it to your include path.

After installation you should restart your `zabbix-agent` manually for inclusion new `UserParameter` from extension configuration.

#### Manual build

```sh
# Building
git clone https://github.com/Einic/zabbix-agent-template.git
cd zabbix-extension-elasticsearch
make

#Installing
make install

# By default, binary installs into /usr/bin/ and zabbix config in /etc/zabbix/zabbix_agentd.conf.d/ but,
# you may manually copy binary to your executable path and zabbix config to specific include directory
```


#### Arch Linux package
```sh
# Building
git clone https://github.com/Einic/zabbix-agent-template.git
git checkout pkgbuild

./build.sh

#Installing
pacman -U *.tar.xz
```

### Dependencies

zabbix-extension-elasticsearch requires [zabbix-agent](http://www.zabbix.com/download) v2.4+ to run.

### Zabbix configuration
In order to start getting metrics, it is enough to import template and attach it to monitored node.

`WARNING:` You must define macro with name - `{$ZABBIX_SERVER_IP}` in global or local (template) scope with IP address of  zabbix server.

On one node of cluster set MACRO `{$GROUPNAME}` = `REAL_ZABBIX_GROUP`. This group must include all nodes of the cluster.
Only this one node will be triggered cluster status (low level discovery added aggregate checks of cluster health).

### Customize key prefix
It may you need if key in template already used.

If you need change key `elasticsearch.*` -> `YOUR_PREFIX_PART.elasticsearch.*`, run script `custom_key_template.sh` whit `YOUR_PREFIX_PART` and import updated zabbix template `template_elasticsearch_service.xml`.

```sh
./custom_key_template.sh YOUR_PREFIX_PART
```

### Elasticsearch API authentication (X-Pack security)

This extension support basic authentication which provided by X-Pack. For authentication in Elasticsearch you must set valid values in template macros - `${ES_USER}` and `${ES_PASSWORD}`

### Customize Elasticsearch address.

You can customize you Elasticsearch listen address.
Just change`{$ES_ADDRESS}` macros in template.
Possible values are - `(http|https)://host:port`

Be note if you choose `https` and have self-signed certificate you also should add path to you CA in marcos `{$CA_PATH}`
